I'm a PhD student at the [School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences](https://fish.uw.edu) at the University of Washington, advised by [Dr. Mark Scheuerell](https://depts.washington.edu/appliedecology/).

My research focuses on applying various quantitative methods to answer questions about the population dynamics, movement, and ecology of marine and anadromous fishes.
